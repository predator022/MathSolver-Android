# PicMatrix
Solving complex math equations has never been much easier.This application allows user to take a snap of the mathematical problem and get 
quick and accurate results.It's simple and easy to use.

## Motivation
Having seen many sci-fi movies an idea always stuck in my mind as to solve equations just be seeing them.With the advent of optical character recognition this was possible and as soon as I had some hands on android development, this project was created.

## Build Status
This can be found on google playstore by "PicMatrix".

## Code Style
This application is built for android platform in JAVA.

## Technology and library
This project is created for android platform and used Optical Character Recognition(OCR) for reading the data in images and then used
Wolfram maths API for quick and accurate maths solutions. It used picasso to display bar graph and images.

## Features
A very convenient way to get maths solutions with graph representaion.Take a quick snap,crop it up and then OCR reads the data. If there
is some changes to be done,that can also easily be done by editing the search results.
